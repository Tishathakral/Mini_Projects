##  Project1
Mouse-Interactive Color Element
This simple web project creates an interactive element that changes its background color based on the position of the mouse cursor. The element dynamically adjusts its color gradient as the mouse moves horizontally within its boundaries.

Features
Interactive Color Change: The element's background color changes dynamically as the mouse cursor moves within its width.
Smooth Transition: Color changes are animated smoothly, providing a visually pleasing experience for users.
Responsive Design: The interactive element adapts to various screen sizes and resolutions.

Move your mouse cursor horizontally over the interactive element to see the color change effect.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Interaction and color calculations.
GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Animation library used for smooth color transitions.
How It Works
The JavaScript code calculates the mouse position within the element and maps it to RGB color values. The GSAP library is used for smooth color transitions. The element's background color changes to red on the left half and blue on the right half as the mouse moves horizontally.
